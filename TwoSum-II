167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Example:
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.


    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        i = 0
        j = len(numbers) - 1
        
        if len(numbers) == 0:
            return []
        
        while i <= j:
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target:
                return [i+1, j+1]
            elif numbers[i] + numbers[j] > target:
                j -= 1
            elif numbers[i] + numbers[j] < target:
                i += 1
        
        return []
